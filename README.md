# Kire Testing Application

A comprehensive data-driven application with a layered architecture including database, .NET backend API, and React frontend.

## Project Structure

This project is organized into three main components, each in its own directory:

- **database/** - Database schemas, migrations, and setup scripts
- **backend/** - .NET Core Web API backend application
- **frontend/** - React TypeScript frontend application

## Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Database Design
Start by designing the database schema and relationships based on the application requirements. Create migration scripts and seed data for development.

### Phase 2: Backend API Development
Develop the .NET backend API with endpoints that map to your database entities. Implement proper authentication, validation, and business logic.

### Phase 3: Frontend Development
Create the React frontend application that communicates with the backend API. Implement UI components, state management, and user interactions.

### Phase 4: Testing
Test all components individually and as an integrated system. Include unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

### Phase 5: Deployment
Set up CI/CD pipelines and deploy to your chosen hosting environment.
