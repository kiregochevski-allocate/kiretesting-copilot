# CI/CD Implementation: Dark Mode and Deployment Pipeline

This document outlines the implementation of dark mode in the frontend application and the setup of a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with Docker containers and Helm charts for ArgoCD deployment.

## Project Components

### Dark Mode Implementation
- Created ThemeContext for managing theme state (light/dark mode)
- Implemented theme toggle functionality in the Layout component
- Added system preference detection with MediaQuery listeners
- Added theme persistence using localStorage
- Configured MUI theming based on the current mode

### CI/CD Pipeline
- Created two GitHub Actions workflows:
  - Basic build and deploy workflow
  - Enhanced CI/CD pipeline with additional testing and security features
- Set up Docker image building and publishing to GitHub Container Registry
- Added automated Helm chart updates based on the deployment environment
- Configured ArgoCD integration for GitOps-based deployments

### Docker Configuration
- Created multi-stage Dockerfile for backend (.NET API)
- Created optimized Dockerfile for frontend (React with NGINX)
- Added NGINX configuration for serving the React app and proxying API calls
- Implemented caching strategies for faster builds

### Helm Chart Structure
- Created a comprehensive Helm chart for the application
- Defined templates for backend and frontend components
- Added environment-specific value overrides (dev, staging, prod)
- Implemented health checks and monitoring support
- Created ArgoCD application definitions for each environment

## Features and Testing

### Backend Features
- Added health check endpoints for Kubernetes probes
- Configured database migration jobs
- Added monitoring endpoints for Prometheus integration
- Created configurable logging setup

### Frontend Features
- Dark mode toggle with system preference detection
- Persistent theme settings via localStorage
- Responsive UI with Material-UI theming

### Security and Quality
- Dependency scanning with OWASP Dependency Check
- Container image scanning with Trivy
- Frontend linting and testing configuration
- Automated code quality checks in CI pipeline

## Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Basic setup with single replicas
- **Staging**: Autoscaling enabled with TLS and monitoring
- **Production**: High-availability configuration with enhanced monitoring

## Future Improvements
- Implement automated database backups
- Add E2E testing with Cypress or Playwright
- Integrate notification systems for deployment events
- Implement canary deployments for production releases
